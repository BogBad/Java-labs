  https://github.com/BogBad/Java-labs
```

# How to Open, Clone, and Run a Project in IntelliJ IDEA, and Generate JavaDoc  

## Opening IntelliJ IDEA  
Launch IntelliJ IDEA. If a project is already open, click on the "burger" menu (three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner and select **"Close Project"**.  

## Cloning a Repository from VCS  
Next, click on **"Get from VCS"** at the top-right corner. Paste the copied repository URL into the designated field. You can also choose the directory where the repository will be saved. After that, click **"Clone"**.  

## Accessing Lab Files  
Once the repository is cloned, you will see six folders (e.g., "lab 1", "lab 2", etc.). To open a lab, click the arrow next to the desired folder to expand it. Continue by expanding the **"src"** folder, then double-click on the **"Main"** file.  

## Running the Main Class  
To run the code, locate the **green triangle** icon next to the `Main` class declaration (near `public class Main`). Click the triangle and select **"Run 'Main.main()'"**. After testing one lab, close the open files at the top of the window, and repeat the process for other labs.  

## Generating JavaDoc  
To generate JavaDoc for a specific lab, select the lab folder by clicking on it once. Open the "burger" menu, and from the options on the right, hover over **"Tools"**. Choose **"Generate JavaDoc..."** from the dropdown.  

In the JavaDoc generation window, select the appropriate scope (e.g., **"Module 'lab 3'"**). Specify the output directory where the JavaDoc should be saved, and then click **"Generate"**.
